 K-Means Clustering on Mall Customers Dataset

📌 Project Description
This project implements the "K-Means Clustering algorithm" to perform customer segmentation using the Mall Customers dataset.  
The objective is to group customers based on their annual income and spending score, helping businesses better understand customer behavior and make data-driven marketing decisions.
